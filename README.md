*Lasso Regression:

Key Role: A powerful tool for feature selection and regularization.
Benefits: By shrinking less important coefficients to zero, Lasso can improve model interpretability and reduce overfitting, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.

*Ridge Regression:

Key Role: A robust technique for addressing multicollinearity and stabilizing model coefficients.
Benefits: By penalizing large coefficients, Ridge regression can improve model generalization and reduce the impact of noise in the data.

*Elastic Net Regression:

Key Role: A flexible approach that combines the strengths of Lasso and Ridge.
Benefits: By balancing feature selection and regularization, Elastic Net can handle high-dimensional datasets with correlated features, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.
